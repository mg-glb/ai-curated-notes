------------------------------------
Machine Learning
-Machine learning is the practice of using algorithms to learn from data, and then make a determination or prediction.
-Types:Supervised Learning, Unsupersived Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

Algorithms: Neural Networks: they are architectured based on the functioning of the human brain. In practice, the Neurons
are in layers.

-----------------------------------------
Data Science
-Data Scientist is the profile that is in charge of making data more useful, in the sense of understanding it's semantics
and behavior.
-Types of data driven tasks: Prediction, Classification and Optimization.
-Step one: Problem Framing.
-Step two: Data understanding/processing.
-Step three: Algorithm selection, train, test.

===============================================================================
WHY AI NOW?
The reason we are implementing AI now is that there have been certain breakthroughs that have made it feasible.
-Big Data has made it hugely available. More business have been diving to it.
-Cloud Computing Services are now accessible.
-Specifically designed hardware has been built.
-Software libraries have been published and tested.
-IoT as a future AI enabler.

-------------------------------------------
Demystifying AI
Andrew NG: Surprisingly, despite AI's breath of impact, the types of it being deployed are still extremely limited.
Almost all of AI's recent progress is through one type, in which some input data (A) is used to quickly generate some
simple response (B).
Examples: Face Recognition. Prediction of loan score. Sales forecasting. Recommendation engines.

Objectives of AI:
-Improve access or processing of information.
-Improve decision making.
-Sub-Person Tailoring (person+context+history)

A lot of noisy data doesn't make sense. Alexa, and other personal assistants combine speech recognition and speech
generation capabilities with natural language understanding, to create a seamless interaction experience.

--------------------------------------------
Artificial Intelligence Projects
What kind of team composes an AI team? 
-Data Scientist: He selects the tools that are going to be used in the project.
-Data Architect/Engineer: He sets up the infrastructure to collect, process, store and access the data.
-UX Designer: He sets up the presentation layer for the AI project.

Other roles:
-Cloud Computing Expert: He controls the scaling of the project.
-User touchpoint Expert: He develops the web/mobile application that makes the project.

The project is built to discover. We then decide how the project is going to be delivered.

Project Steps:
Step One: Problem Definition.
Step Two: Data Collection and Processing.
Step Three: Feature and Architecture Engineering.
Step Four: Model Training.
Step Five: Model Testing, Evaluation and Validation.
Step Six: Model Deployment and Monitoring.

The project is hardly linear. There are several iterations and circlebacks.
-------------------------------------------------
What an AI project is not

-Agile methodology is something desirable, but not so straight to do in AI projects.
-Connecting an AI API is not doing AI. The same way that using a scalpel does not make you a surgeon.
-You need to understand why and how things work in an AI API.
-AI projects require constant interaction with stakeholders. You need to build trust with them, because results are not
immediate. If you don't define the problem you will be in one! Also determine clearly who the stakeholders are.
In short: the process is not chaotic unless we have an ill-defined problem or an ill-defined relationship with the client.
-What makes an application intelligent, is not the connection with different apis, but the design of those connections.
-Garbage in, garbage out.
-----------------------------------------------------
The AI toolset
These are the applications that compose the
-Cognitive Service: An array of API's that create a dataflow(i.e: Google Cloud Services, Azure)
-Task specific API: Stand-alone API's that have a single purpose (i.e: Api.ai, LUIS)
-High level helpers: These are not trained and you have to build them from scratch (i.e: Bonsai,)
-DataTools: Help you implement neural networks.
-Frameworks: Help you create neural networks.
-Languages: Help you write AI APIs.

-------------------------------------------------------
AI Services vs from scratch developments
-Do you have the skills to use either of them?
-Do you want to leverage against the competition?
-Do you have the budget?

Rule of thumb: The higher in the hiererchy you go, the lower amount of work you have to do, but also the lower amount of
control of the result you will have.
So this is basically a consumption based rate vs a more flexible cost structure.

High level tools=>Less time to market.
Low level tools=>More control of the results and ownership of intellectual property.

High level tools=>Already trained models for task-oriented but general domain tasks.
Low level tools=>Domain specific tasks.

High level tools=>Less privacy
Low level tools=>Less reliability

High level tools=>Fast POC. Similar to automated website development.

Morale: At the beginning, don't reinvent the wheel. Later, you can do some rocket science.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Some algorithms

What is the engine that drives AI? What kind of tools can you have? Tip: it's not black magic.
There are two types of algorithms:
-Classification algorithms: Naive Bayes(1), Support Vector Machines (2), K-Nearest Neighbourghs(3), Decision Trees(4)
-Regression algorithms: Generalized Regression (1), Regression Tree (2), Time Series Methods (3)

Select algorithms by objective. NN's can solve either classification or regression problems, but they are usually selected
by their architecture. Different NN architectures can make them better for solving particular problems.

Neural Network Types:
-Deep Neural Network (DNN): Have lots of hidden layers. They recognize patterns in data.
-Convulutional Neural Networks (CNN): Look for patterns, knowing that a particular pattern exists.
-Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): These networks look at the history to find values or patterns.
-Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): You are pairing two networks. One tries to classify real from fake data. The other
tries to generate data that cannot be distinguished from real one. You feed the first with the last. Repeat until the last
is good enough to qualify as intelligent.
-Ensemble Learning: You have different algorithms working and voting together to solve a problem involving classification
or regression. (Example: Random Forest).
---------------------------------------------------------------
Examples
You should not use verticals. This is because:
1-Crosspolination is the key source of innovation.
2-State of the Art is not business defined, but focused on capabilities of the techniques.
3-Creativity and innovation are "still our job", whether in tech or business.

Types:
-Recommendation Systems (i.e Netflix: 75% of people views what comes from the recommendation. Amazon also).
-Chatboxes and assistants. (i.e Alexa: They use interactions with users to improve themselves).
-Seamless experiences.
-Process optimization algorithms (i.e Amazon Fresh)
-Search prediction (i.e: Google Search)
-Ad Placing

Some fintech examples:
-Fraud detection and prevention.
-Stock Value Forecasting.
-Valuation Modeling using sentiment analysis.
-Topic extraction.

Storage management
-Counting items in a shelf or deposit.

Revenue optimization
-Prices are dynamically set using algorithms that estimate the best price for an item or service based on users and their
context. The goal is to maximize sales or revenue.

E-learning
-Attrition Prediction: They can predict if a user is going to drop out from a course (hello Maxi). The system then tackles
the behavior that makes the user leave.

Healthcare
-There are some initiatives that use both AI and IoT to improve the life quality of elder people. Algorithms are used to
detect (and even predict!) the occurence of a home accident or a health breakdown, so doctors can be aware of the situation
and react faster.
-Using voice prosody and facial recognition, it is possible to determine the emotional state of a person. Having this
knowledge can lead to the creation more adaptive and integrated digital journeys. These services not only fit the customer
needs, but also how are they feeling at every moment.
----------------------------------------------------------
Closing thoughts
AI is powerful enough that is going to impact the philosophy.
-Biases: Non-desirable behavior (racism, sexism,xenophobia)
-Regulation and policy: Who is responsible? When and who is going to regulate?
-Creativity: Can computers "create" things or ideas?

Who to follow?
-Andrew Ng.
-Yann Lecun.
-Coursera and Udacity.
------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Side (of the Force!)
The dangers of AI. Evolutionary danger: AI surpassing humans as a species. AI having different objectives than humans. Not
having a worldview of what is going on around them.
